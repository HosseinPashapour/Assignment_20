Normal function detection program with symmetric function.

 list            | out put 
-----------------|---------
 [1, 4, 3, 4, 1] | True    
 [1, 2, 3]       | False

># Digikala_store_Query_sqlite

## Overview

In this practice i made a database using SQLite for a website like digikala and use 4 main operators (Create Read Update Delete) by sql 

create datebase and set query with sql

sql name | description            
---------|------------------------
Insert_Product | add data to database   
Select_available | get data from database 
Delete_foreign_customers | delete data            
Update_20percent  | update data            


## Instructions

In these part I work with SQLite to use four below command:

INSERT
DELETE
UPDATE
SELECT

these four command are related to sql language and used to work with different database.

with INSER we can add a new data to a table in database.
with DELETE we can remove an item from a table in database.
with UPDATE we can edite an item from a table in database.
with SELECT we can show an item or more from a table in database.

## How to Run
there are four .sql file in sql folder that you can see how these commands work.
